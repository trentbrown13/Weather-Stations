Should be ready for V0.0.0.709
Next:
    1: Finish callibration
    2: Clean up Node Red display to be consistent. Look at using a template - should be a simple find/replace in the json file?
    3: Add Deep Sleep if Batt Voltage is to low
      1: Free up D0 by swapping D0 and D5 (currently open); D0 and D5 are next door, RST is one removed from D0
      2: Connect D0 with RST
      3: Declare int deepSleepTime - time in seconds to sleep, can be changed in Node Red
      4: Declare int deepSleepVoltage - lowest voltage reading before deep sleep kicks in
      4: In setup
	      a) take sensor readings and publish
	      b) If ADC reading  is < deepSleepVoltage
		        ESP.deepSleep(deepSleeptime * 1000000);
